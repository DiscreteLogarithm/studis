The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the rights granted on the Software under this Licence.

3.   Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Software either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code. If the Software is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Software along with each copy of the Software that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Software, a repository where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Software.

4.   Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

5.   Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Software he/she distributes or communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Software to carry prominent notices stating that the Software has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Softwares or Derivative Softwares, this Distribution or Communication will be done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence unless the Original Software is expressly distributed only under this version of the Licence — for example by communicating ‘NDPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Software or Derivative Software that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Non-Discriminatory clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the Original Softwares or Derivative Softwares, this Distribution or Communication must be done in a Non-Discriminatory manner as defined in Article 1 of this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under any local law conflict with his/her obligations under the Non-Discriminatory clause of this Licence, the obligations of this Licence shall prevail. This Non-Discriminatory clause is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any communication, distribution, or sublicense rights to the Software.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Software, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Software.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Software and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

6.   Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Software granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Software are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Software, under the terms of this Licence.

7.   Disclaimer of Warranty

The Software is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.

For the above reason, the Software is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Software, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Software.

8.   Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Software, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Software.

9.   Additional agreements

While distributing the Software, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.

10.   Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Software, the creation by You of a Derivative Software or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Software or copies thereof.

11.   Information to the public

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Software by means of electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Software from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12.   Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Software from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.

13.   Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Software.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

Morteza Jalalvand may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

14.   Jurisdiction

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties, any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary business.

15.   Applicable Law

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

—   this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,

—   this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat, residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.
